Thank you for clicking into this section (hug hug). But as a first-year Ph.D. student, I am still struggling to get my first paper published. I believe we shall soon see the first and then more publications in the near future. 

Recently, I have two papers under review, which could not be listed here due to the double-blind priciple.

Yes, I do have my deepest faith in that. \\(>v<)/

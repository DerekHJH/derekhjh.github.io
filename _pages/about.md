Hooray~ you caught me! I am Junhao Hu, a first-year Ph.D. student at [School of Computer Science, Peking University](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Tao Xie](https://taoxiease.github.io/).

My research is in the intersection of programming language, software engineering and machine learning. Specifically, I am currently focusing on the testing and quantization process of deep learning compilers. If you are also interested in those topics and want to work something out together, please do not hesitate to contact me. 

I got my bachelor's degree from [Kuang Yaming Honors School, Nanjing University](https://dii.nju.edu.cn/) in 2022, where I did research on Compilation Resource Predicion, advised by Prof. [Yanyan Jiang](https://jyywiki.cn/).

(BTW, you could see a bigger and clearer version of my photo in the upper left corner by clicking the right mouse button to open it in a new page. I am a relatively shy person, and that is why I wear sunglasses >_<)



<!-- If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html). -->

<!-- Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory). -->

<!-- **Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository. -->
